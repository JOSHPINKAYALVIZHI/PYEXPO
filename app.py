        I am deeply interested in the field of artificial intelligence, where technology can work with 
        human ideas to solve tough problems. My goal is to become an AI Engineer, as I believe AI has the power to change 
        industries, improve lives, and help us learn new things. I love the mix of math, coding, and data work involved in
        building intelligent systems that can learn and adapt on their own. I‚Äôm excited to keep growing my skills and want 
        to use them to create helpful solutions that make a positive impact on the world.
